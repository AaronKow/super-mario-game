# Purpose & Inspiration

This project is an educational recreation of the famous game [Super Mario Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) by Nintendo.

The game is built using the open-source JavaScript game framework [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/), which handles animations, scenes, data management, in-game event communications, inputs, and more.

The original codebase was inspired by [Super-Mario-Phaser](https://github.com/pablogozalvez/Super-Mario-Phaser) by [pablogozalvez](https://github.com/pablogozalvez). I have reorganized the code into a more defined structure with classes and integrated a build tool to streamline the build process.
